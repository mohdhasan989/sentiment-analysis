# sentiment-analysis
Collected and used a dataset of text/sentences
Labeled the data as positive / negative / neutral → making it a supervised learning 
Problem:-
Preprocessed the data (cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords)
Applied NLP techniques and trained a machine learning model
Evaluated outcomes with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Key Outcomes:
Built a model that can classify the sentiment of a sentence
Learned how supervised learning applies in real-world NLP tasks
Strengthened my fundamentals of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation
--->This project might be small, but it’s a big milestone for me. Every expert once started with their first project, and this is mine toward becoming a hashtag#DataScientist and future hashtag#GenAIdeveloper.
